First of all, thank you very much for a truly challenging  assignment, it was very different from the assignments I usually do, secondly, I wanted to give some guidance through my app and some notes:

I really tried to add it to docker but it requires windows 10 pro, which I do not own (at least that what the .exe file stated when I tried to install it).

The swagger UI path is: localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

The general home page is just: localhost:8080

The github link is : https://github.com/Whitelister/Stock.git

I'm fairly new to angular and I am trying now to create the web page using it but I figured that a .jsp file will be close enough, that is why I didn't delete it.
